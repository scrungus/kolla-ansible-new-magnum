upgrade:

    Adds ``elasticsearch_use_v6`` and ``kibana_use_v6`` flags which can be set
    to ``true`` to deploy the ``elasticsearch6`` and ``kibana6`` images on
    CentOS 7 or 8. These flags are ``true`` by default on CentOS 8, and
    ``false`` elsewhere. The services should be upgraded from 5.x to 6.x via
    ``kolla-ansible upgrade elasticsearch,kibana``, and this can be used to
    provide an Elasticsearch 6.x cluster that is compatible between CentOS 7
    and 8.
