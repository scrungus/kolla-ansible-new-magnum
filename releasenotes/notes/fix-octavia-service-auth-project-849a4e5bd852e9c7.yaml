    In the previous stable release, the octavia user was no longer given the
    admin role in the admin project, and a task was added to remove the role
    during upgrades. However, the octavia configuration was not updated to use
    the service project, causing load balancer creation to fail. See upgrade
    notes for details.  `LP#1873176

    In the previous stable release, the octavia user was no longer given the
    admin role in the admin project, and a task was added to remove the role
    during upgrades. However, the octavia configuration was not updated to use
    the service project, causing load balancer creation to fail.

    There is also an issue for existing deployments in simply switching to the
    service project. While existing load balancers appear to continue to work,
    creating new load balancers fails due to the security group belonging to
    the admin project. For this reason, Train and Stein have been reverted to
    use the admin project by default, while from the Ussuri release the service
    project will be used by default.

    To provide flexibility, an ``octavia_service_auth_project`` variable has
    been added. In the Train and Stein releases this is set to ``admin`` by
    default, and from Ussuri it will be set to ``service`` by default.
    For users of Train and Stein, ``octavia_service_auth_project`` may be set
    to ``service`` in order to avoid a breaking change during the Ussuri
    upgrade.

    To switch an existing deployment from using the ``admin`` project to the
    ``service`` project, it will at least be necessary to create the required
    security group in the ``service`` project, and update
    ``octavia_amp_secgroup_list`` to this group's ID. Ideally the Amphora
    flavor and network would also be recreated in the ``service`` project,
    although this does not appear to be necessary for operation, and will
    impact existing Amphorae.
